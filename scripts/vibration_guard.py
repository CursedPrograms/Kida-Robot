# vibration_guard.py — treat rapid ball-switch toggles as a vibration/shock
# event and slow down until things settle.
#
# The ball switch (BALL_PIN on dev01, scripts/arduino/arduino01/ardiuno01.ino)
# is a tilt switch: a loose metal ball rolls to bridge or break contact. A
# single steady reading only tells you the robot's tilt. Under vibration or
# a shock, the ball bounces and the contact flickers rapidly between 0/1
# several times inside a second — so vibration shows up as toggle *rate*,
# not the raw value. dev01 reports BALL every ~250ms, so we watch the last
# few reads for a burst of flips.
