# mode_control.py — centralised mode-switching logic for KIDA
#
# The autonomous fix lives here: when entering AUTONOMOUS mode we
# immediately send AUTO_ON to the Arduino so it starts its
# obstacleAvoidance() loop.  When leaving we send AUTO_OFF.
#
# Usage:
#   from mode_control import switch_mode
#   switch_mode(3)   # → AUTONOMOUS
