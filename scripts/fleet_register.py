# fleet_register.py — announces this KIDA instance to the RIFT/NORA fleet registry
#
# NORA (https://github.com/CursedPrograms/NORA-Robot-v00) is the network's
# always-on node at a fixed address, hosting the fleet registry (/register,
# /robots on port 5000) that RIFT (https://github.com/CursedPrograms/RIFT)
# reads from and can claim authority over. This mirrors RIFT's own
# Fleet/register.py client pattern exactly, so KIDA shows up as a first-class
# fleet member (name, type, capabilities) rather than just a bare mDNS peer.
#
# Safe to start even if NORA isn't reachable (different network, still
# booting, etc.) — it just keeps retrying on the same interval and never
# raises.
